# Librextjs

Librextjs is open source javascript framework.

This is a fork of Extjs 4.2.1 built using `grunt` and `jsduck`.

## Build

Install grunt to generate source files into single file.

    $ npm install
    $ grunt

To generate documentation, install `jsduck` using `gem`.

    $ gem install jsduck
    $ jsduck

Note: Documentation is not fully working now, you can only view it using web server
and inline example does not work, yet.

## TODO

* Built css
* Include guide in docs
* Include example in docs
